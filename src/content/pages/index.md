about:
  title: My desire to help others began early on in life.
  content:
    - >-
      Like many others in this field, I first practiced massage through helping
      my family and friends. Sometimes that meant offering a scalp or hand
      massage to my tired mother after work, or trying to soothe a sore neck and
      shoulder after sleeping the wrong way (we've all been there).

      I experienced my first professional massage in 2022. I then realized that
      I wanted to learn how to make people feel better and live with less pain
      and stress.
    - >-
      In December of 2024, I graduated from Harrisburg Area Community College's
      900 hour Massage Therapy program, and soon afterwards passed my MBLEX
      exam. During my training I learned to apply massage techniques such as
      Swedish, deep tissue, Neuromuscular Therapy, Spa and Sports massage, and
      Connective Tissue/myofascial work.

      My belief is that when we approach the pain held in our body with
      curiosity, compassion, and intention, we move closer towards a pain free
      life. When we listen to and respect our bodies signals instead of pushing
      ourselves beyond our limits, developing healthier habits and goals becomes
      easier and our overall quality of life improves.
    - I am here to help!

      Under my care, each client can expect an individualized experience,
      starting with a thorough health intake process. This helps me to better
      understand your pain as well as any goals you may have in mind during your
      health journey. It also helps me to provide the safest, most effective
      treatment that is best suited to your needs.
    - >-
      During massage sessions, I want my clients to feel comfortable and in
      total control of the experience. Feedback lets me know what is and isn't
      working for you, so you can rest assured that you can always feel
      confident voicing your concerns with me.

      If there is ever a need for specialized treatment that I do not currently
      offer, I will do my part to refer you to someone better qualified in
      addressing your needs.
    - >-
      This is a team effort, and it's important to me that you feel empowered to
      make your own health decisions on what kind of care you receive.
modalities:
  title: Massage Modalities
  content:
    - name: Swedish
      description: In this type of massage, we will focus on restoring a sense of calm and overall balance. Relaxation is found through application of long, gliding massage strokes in a rhythmic and flowing sequence. This is a popular choice if your goal is to unwind and de-stress.
    - name: Deep tissue/Neuromuscular Therapy (NMT)
      description: This style of massage takes more time, and generally targets just a few areas of discomfort in order to provide relief to specific muscles. Techniques such as trigger point therapy may be applied as needed in order to reduce muscle tension and increase range of motion. This modality involves deeper pressure and a lot more communication between client and therapist regarding pain tolerance and comfort level.
